# Novel Isoform Analysis
This script generates an excel table containing the novel isoforms that were confirmed with unique peptides. Optinally, spectra plots can be generated with matplotlib. The paper does not use these plots, rather uses MetaDraw for spectra plotting

To run:
>`bash run_novel.sh`
